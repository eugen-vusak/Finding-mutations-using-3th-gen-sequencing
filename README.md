# Finding mutations using 3th generation sequencing
This is a project for [Bioinformatics class](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/predmet/bio). It's about finding mutations using 3th gen sequencing method.

## Test data
https://www.dropbox.com/s/iqi3nbf839wrshh/Bioinfo_19_20_train_data.tar.gz?dl=0

**Description**

    ecoli.fasta - reference genome
    ecoli_mutated.csv - list of mutations to find
    ecoli_mutated.report - reading statistics and reference implementation's Jaccards score
    ecoli_simulated_reads.fasta - readings obtained by sequencing the mutated genome
    jaccard.py - script for computing Jaccard's score

    Same goes for another dataset lambda.
